# Excel Column Name
This code demonstrates an algorithm for finding the Excel column name by its serial number and vice versa.

## Example
Suppose that the function f(n) takes a number and returns the name of the Excel column that corresponds to this number. Then:
+ f(1) = "A"
+ f(2) = "B"
+ f(26) = "Z"
+ f(27) = "AA"
+ f(50) = "AX"
+ f(53) = "BA"
+ f(703) = "AAA"
